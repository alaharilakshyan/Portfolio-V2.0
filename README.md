* **Fast and responsive**, ensuring great user experience on all devices.
* **Interactive design elements** keep users engaged.

Would you like me to include **live demo and preview images** sections (e.g., screenshots and `Live Demo → https://portfolio-v2-lakshyan.vercel.app`)?  
I can add those too for a more complete and professional GitHub README.
